## Load and preprocess the data
The date dimension was originally a 'char'. Best to change this to 'Date'.


```r
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
str(activity)

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
First, I needed to get the steps per day. Then I was able to get to the mean total number of steps per day.


```r
steps_per_day <- activity %>% group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(steps_sum=sum(steps,rm.na=TRUE))
ggplot(steps_per_day,aes(x=steps_sum)) + geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title='Histogram of Total Steps Per Day',x='Steps',y='Frequency Count')
```

```

print(paste('Median total steps per day:',median(steps_per_day$steps_sum, 
  na.rm = TRUE)))
```

```
## [1] "Median total steps per day: 10766"
```

```r
print(paste('Mean total steps per day:',as.integer(mean(steps_per_day$steps_sum, 
  na.rm = TRUE))))
```

```
## [1] "Mean total steps per day: 10767"

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
I determined the average steps for each interval and then graphed it over time. Then I mapped the max back to the interval to highlight the most active interval on average.


```r
steps_per_interval <- activity %>% group_by(interval) %>% 
  summarize(steps_mean=mean(steps,na.rm = TRUE))
ggplot(steps_per_interval,aes(x=interval,y=steps_mean)) + geom_line() + 
  labs(title='Average Daily Activity',x='Interval',y='Step Mean')
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
max_interval <- steps_per_interval[steps_per_interval$steps_mean == 
                                     max(steps_per_interval$steps_mean),]$interval
print(paste('Interval with most steps on average:',max_interval))
```

```
## [1] "Interval with most steps on average: 835"
```

## Imputing missing values
I determined there were missing values for steps. I then replaced those with the interval average. I replotted the histogram and calculated the median and mean to see if there was much of a difference, which there wasn't.


```r
summary(activity)
```

```
##      steps             date               interval

##  3rd Qu.: 12.00   3rd Qu.:2012-11-15   3rd Qu.:1766.2  
##  Max.   :806.00   Max.   :2012-11-30   Max.   :2355.0  
##  NA's   :2304
```

```r
print(paste("Total # of rows with missing NAs, which only occurs with 'steps': ",
  sum(!complete.cases(activity$steps))))
```

```
## [1] "Total # of rows with missing NAs, which only occurs with 'steps':  2304"
```

```r
activity_cleansed <- activity %>% group_by(interval) %>% mutate(steps = 
  replace_na(steps, mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)))
steps_per_day_cleansed <- activity_cleansed %>% group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(steps_sum=sum(steps))

ggplot(steps_per_day_cleansed,aes(x=steps_sum)) + geom_histogram() +

       y='Frequency Count')

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
First, I created a function to determine which days were weekdays or weekends. Then I did a panel plot, plotting the two side by side. Weekends have more activity throughout the day, as expected.

```r
wd_or_we <- function(x) {
  day_name<-weekdays(x)
  if(day_name=='Saturday' | day_name=='Sunday'){
    'weekend'
  } else {
    'weekday'
  }
}
activity_cleansed$day_type <- sapply(activity_cleansed$date,wd_or_we)
head(activity_cleansed)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 Ã— 4
## # Groups:   interval [6]
##    steps date       interval day_type
##    <dbl> <date>        <int> <chr>   
## 1 1.72   2012-10-01        0 weekday 
## 2 0.340  2012-10-01        5 weekday 
## 3 0.132  2012-10-01       10 weekday 
## 4 0.151  2012-10-01       15 weekday 
## 5 0.0755 2012-10-01       20 weekday 
## 6 2.09   2012-10-01       25 weekday
```

```r
to_plot <- activity_cleansed %>% group_by(day_type,interval) %>% 
  summarize(avg_steps=mean(steps))
```

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'day_type'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.
```

```r
ggplot(to_plot,aes(x=interval,y=avg_steps)) + geom_line() + 
  facet_grid(day_type ~ .) + labs(title='Average Daily Activity',x='Interval',
                                  y='Step Mean')
```
