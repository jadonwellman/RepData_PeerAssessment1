## Load and preprocess the data
The date dimension was originally a 'char'. Best to change this to 'Date'.


```r
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
str(activity)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	17568 obs. of  3 variables:
##  $ steps   : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
##  $ date    : chr  "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" ...
##  $ interval: int  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 ...
```

```r
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)
str(activity)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
First, I needed to get the steps per day. Then I was able to get to the mean total number of steps per day.


```r
steps_per_day <- activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(sum(steps))
steps_per_day <- rename(steps_per_day,steps = `sum(steps)`)
attach(steps_per_day)
hist(steps)
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
print(paste('Median total steps per day:',median(steps, 
  na.rm = TRUE)))
```

```
## [1] "Median total steps per day: 10765"
```

```r
print(paste('Mean total steps per day:',mean(steps, 
  na.rm = TRUE)))
```

```
## [1] "Mean total steps per day: 10766.1886792453"
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
I determined the average steps for each interval and then graphed it over time. Then I mapped the max back to the interval to highlight the most active interval on average.


```r
steps_per_interval <- activity %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarize(mean(steps,
  na.rm = TRUE))
steps_per_interval <- rename(steps_per_interval,
                             steps = `mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)`)
attach(steps_per_interval)
```

```
## The following object is masked from steps_per_day:
## 
##     steps
```

```r
plot(x=interval,y=steps,type = 'l')
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
max_interval <- steps_per_interval[steps == max(steps),]$interval
print(paste('Interval with most steps on average:',max_interval))
```

```
## [1] "Interval with most steps on average: 835"
```

## Imputing missing values
I determined there were missing values for steps. I then replaced those with the interval average. I replotted the histogram and calculated the median and mean to see if there was much of a difference, which there wasn't.


```r
summary(activity)
```

```
##      steps             date               interval     
##  Min.   :  0.00   Min.   :2012-10-01   Min.   :   0.0

##  Median :  0.00   Median :2012-10-31   Median :1177.5  
##  Mean   : 37.38   Mean   :2012-10-31   Mean   :1177.5  
##  3rd Qu.: 12.00   3rd Qu.:2012-11-15   3rd Qu.:1766.2  
##  Max.   :806.00   Max.   :2012-11-30   Max.   :2355.0  
##  NA's   :2304
```

```r
print(paste("Total # of rows with missing NAs, which only occurs with 'steps': ",
  sum(!complete.cases(activity$steps))))
```

```
## [1] "Total # of rows with missing NAs, which only occurs with 'steps':  2304"
```

```r
activity_cleansed <- activity %>% group_by(interval) %>% mutate(steps = 
  replace_na(steps, mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)))
steps_per_day_cleansed <- activity_cleansed %>% group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(sum(steps))
steps_per_day_cleansed <- rename(steps_per_day_cleansed,steps = `sum(steps)`)

attach(steps_per_day_cleansed)

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
First, I created a function to determine which days were weekdays or weekends. Then I did a panel plot, plotting the two side by side. Weekends have more activity throughout the day, as expected.

```r
wd_or_we <- function(x) {
  day_name<-weekdays(x)
  if(day_name=='Saturday' | day_name=='Sunday'){
    'weekend'
  } else {
    'weekday'
  }
}
activity_cleansed$day_type <- sapply(activity_cleansed$date,wd_or_we)
head(activity_cleansed)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 Ã— 4
## # Groups:   interval [6]
##    steps date       interval day_type
##    <dbl> <date>        <int> <chr>   
## 1 1.72   2012-10-01        0 weekday

## 5 0.0755 2012-10-01       20 weekday 
## 6 2.09   2012-10-01       25 weekday
```

```r
activity_cleansed_weekday <- activity_cleansed[
  activity_cleansed$day_type == 'weekday',]
activity_cleansed_weekend <- activity_cleansed[
  activity_cleansed$day_type == 'weekend',]

steps_per_interval_weekday <- activity_cleansed_weekday %>% 
  group_by(interval) %>% summarize(mean(steps))
steps_per_interval_weekday <- rename(steps_per_interval_weekday,
                             steps = `mean(steps)`)

steps_per_interval_weekend <- activity_cleansed_weekend %>% 
  group_by(interval) %>% summarize(mean(steps))
steps_per_interval_weekend <- rename(steps_per_interval_weekend,
                                     steps = `mean(steps)`)

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
